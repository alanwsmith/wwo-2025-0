  <p><a href="https://weirdweboctober.website/">Weird Web October</a> is
    like <a href="https://inktober.com/">Inktober</a>. Except, you don't
    make a drawing every day of the month. You build a website.
    Each one is based off a theme for the day. 
    Given <a href="https://subdomains.alanwsmith.com/">how much I
      love making sites</a>, it's right up my alley. 
  </p>

  <h2>A bitty Test Run</h2>
  <p>The timing also works great for another project 
    I've been working on called <a href="https://bitty.alanwsmith.com/">bitty</a>. 
    It's a web component that uses signals to add reactivity to pages. 
    I designed it specifically to make it easier to 
    functional sites and pages. Weird Web October is a 
    perfect use case. 
  </p>
  <p>
    There's no framework our build step required. You just
    load the component with <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> 
    then wrap your content inside it. 
    From there everything is done with native <code>data-*</code>
    attributes that call out to vanilla JavaScript functions
    that power whatever you want to do. 
  </p>

  <p>I'm still working on the docs and intro video for bitty, but
    there's a bunch of examples on the site showing how it works.
    Give it a shot if you like to tinker with things and 
    <a href="https://socials.alanwsmith.com/">let me know what you think</a>.
